vizerator.js
============

Vizerator is a plotting and data visualization library for Javascript that uses
D3.js. It seeks to implement a number of common plot types on top of many of the
excellent tools provided by D3.js. It also attempts, as a secondary goal, to
make it relatively easy to add new plot types that use common plotting idioms
and elements.

The library can be built with `make`, which will produce both debugging and
production versions of the code, and the examples can be configured with
`make examples`.
